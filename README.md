# A passionate Python programmer from France

Welcome to my Github!

I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Oracle. In my free time, I like spending time working on several personal projects using Python, composing music and playing videogames. I always try to work on programming projects that correlate with my other interests: I worked on several projects related to music composition using Python, and I also have experience with game dev with the Pygame library.
